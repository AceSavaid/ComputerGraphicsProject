### Explaination & Documentation  
Worked on scripts for a base of the project as they were already started on in the project and it didnt make sense to redo them.
Probuilder and https://cpetry.github.io/NormalMap-Online/ were used.

### Explaination & Documentation  
Some scripts like the base player and genral kill scrips were made as a group as a base and then edited in the scenes as the project was in progression and it would not be optimal to recode the same scripts and mechanics for the project multiple times over.  
Probuilder was used.
